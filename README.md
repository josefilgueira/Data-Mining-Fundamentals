# Data Mining Fundamentals – Master’s Coursework

This repository contains a data mining assignment completed as part of my Master’s program.  
The project focuses on **applying core data mining techniques using Python**, combining exploratory analysis, data preparation, and basic predictive modeling on a structured dataset.

The objective of the work is educational, aimed at understanding the **end-to-end workflow of a data mining task**, from raw data to model evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset

The analysis is based on a structured dataset provided in Excel format, containing multiple numerical and categorical variables.

The dataset is used to practice:
- Data inspection and preprocessing
- Feature selection and transformation
- Application of different data mining techniques

---

## 🔎 Analysis Workflow

The notebook follows a clear and progressive structure:

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Importing the dataset into Python
- Basic inspection of variables and data types
- Initial descriptive statistics

### 2. Data Preparation
- Handling input variables for modeling
- Separating features and target variables
- Preparing the dataset for machine learning algorithms

### 3. Data Mining Techniques

Several fundamental techniques are applied and compared, including:

- **Clustering**
  - Unsupervised grouping of observations
  - Interpretation of cluster structure

- **Classification**
  - Training and evaluating classification models
  - Comparing predicted vs. real class labels

- **Regression**
  - Modeling numerical target variables
  - Evaluating model performance using error metrics

The focus is on **understanding how each technique behaves**, rather than on fine-tuning or optimization.

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Basic evaluation strategies are used to assess results, such as:

- Accuracy and error-based metrics
- Comparison between different modeling approaches
- Interpretation of outputs and limitations
